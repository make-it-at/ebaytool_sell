About Import Duties When Purchasing from Japan to the United States
Thank you very much for your interest in products from Japan.

When importing goods into the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may impose import duties or taxes depending on the type and value of the items.

Thanks to the U.S.–Japan trade agreement, many products can be imported duty-free.

If the total value of your purchase is under $800 USD, you are generally exempt from duties under the ""de minimis exemption"" rule.

However, if the total exceeds $800 or if the item falls under a restricted category, a duty of around 0% to 10% may be applied, based on the product’s HS code classification.

We include a detailed invoice with all shipments to help ensure smooth customs clearance.

If you have any questions about specific import duties or customs procedures, please don’t hesitate to contact us—we’re happy to help in any way we can.

Once again, thank you for considering a purchase from Japan. We are committed to making your shopping experience as smooth and worry-free as possible.</label><br /><br /><header><h2>shipping method</h2></header><label>Your order will be dispatched to you from Japan within the designated handling time from the date of payment.</label><br /><br /><header><h2>Transaction matters</h2></header><label>Packing state: We will carefully pack your items with the most appropriate protection materials to avoid your items from getting damaged during transport to you.

About Import Duties When Purchasing from Japan to the United States
Thank you very much for your interest in products from Japan.

When importing goods into the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may impose import duties or taxes depending on the type and value of the items.

If the total value of your purchase is under $800 USD, you are generally exempt from duties under the ""de minimis exemption"" rule.

However, if the total exceeds $800 or if the item falls under a restricted category, a duty of around 0% to 10% may be applied, based on the product’s HS code classification.

We include a detailed invoice with all shipments to help ensure smooth customs clearance.

We include a detailed invoice with all shipments to help ensure smooth customs clearance.

When importing goods into the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may impose import duties or taxes depending on the type and value of the items.

Thanks to the U.S.–Japan trade agreement, many products can be imported duty-free.

If the total value of your purchase is under $800 USD, you are generally exempt from duties under the ""de minimis exemption"" rule.

However, if the total exceeds $800 or if the item falls under a restricted category, a duty of around 0% to 10% may be applied, based on the product’s HS code classification.

We include a detailed invoice with all shipments to help ensure smooth customs clearance.

If you have any questions about specific import duties or customs procedures, please don’t hesitate to contact us—we’re happy to help in any way we can.

Once again, thank you for considering a purchase from Japan.

About Import Duties When Purchasing from Japan to the United States
Thank you very much for your interest in products from Japan.

When importing goods into the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may impose import duties or taxes depending on the type and value of the items.

Thanks to the U.S.–Japan trade agreement, many products can be imported duty-free.

If the total value of your purchase is under $800 USD, you are generally exempt from duties under the ""de minimis exemption"" rule.

However, if the total exceeds $800 or if the item falls under a restricted category, a duty of around 0% to 10% may be applied, based on the product’s HS code classification.

We include a detailed invoice with all shipments to help ensure smooth customs clearance.

If you have any questions about specific import duties or customs procedures, please don’t hesitate to contact us—we’re happy to help in any way we can.

Once again, thank you for considering a purchase from Japan.

About Import Duties When Purchasing from Japan to the United States
Thank you very much for your interest in products from Japan.

When importing goods into the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may impose import duties or taxes depending on the type and value of the items.

If the total value of your purchase is under $800 USD, you are generally exempt from duties under the ""de minimis exemption"" rule.

However, if the total exceeds $800 or if the item falls under a restricted category, a duty of around 0% to 10% may be applied, based on the product’s HS code classification.

We include a detailed invoice with all shipments to help ensure smooth customs clearance.

If you have any questions about specific import duties or customs procedures, please don’t hesitate to contact us—we’re happy to help in any way we can.

About Import Duties When Purchasing from Japan to the United States
Thank you very much for your interest in products from Japan.

When importing goods into the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may impose import duties or taxes depending on the type and value of the items.
